I attended a bootcamp called 'data-science-bootcamp-9' lectured, guided and inspired by p'Toy DataRockie
Here is the repository to store the assignments from the comprehensive bootcamp.

On Dec 2023, I've gone to a half way of the bootcamp-9. It is planned to finished in 2024 first Quarter.
- sql
- r
- data-transform
- data-visualization

I enjoy learning these things, some of them I have experienced prior and some I have none before participating in
this bootcamp. So, I am quite certain that there are areas of improvement. If there is anything wrong, I apologize in advance. Please kindly feel free to comment or correct. 
Really appreciated and so kind of you. Thank you very much.

Best,
